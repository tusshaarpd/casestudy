Case study for builiding a complete HR assessment platform



Problem Statement:
Designing Cohort's Candidate Assessment Feature: For this exercise, imagine you're leading the development of a new feature for Cohort: an AI-powered candidate assessment tool to help companies evaluate candidates with greater precision and efficiency
Assumptions have been made if not specified in problem statement 
Market & User Research
Who are the primary and secondary users of this feature? 
•	Primary Users: Recruiters and hiring managers responsible for sourcing, evaluating, and hiring candidates, particularly for tech roles. 
•	Secondary Users: Candidates, HR personnel, and company executives involved in or impacted by the hiring process
Each of these stakeholders has distinct needs: recruiters want speed and accuracy, candidates want a fair process, and HR/execs want reliable data and compliance.
What are their key pain points in current assessment processes?
1.	Over-reliance on Memorised knowledge: Many standardized tests primarily measure the memorized concepts This means candidates who perform well on these tests may not necessarily have a deep understanding of the subject matter or the ability to apply that knowledge in real implementations
2.	Outdated Assessment Content and Methods: As the needs of employer’s change, the methods to prepare and assess candidates also need to evolve. Many current assessments don't encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are increasingly in demand.
3.	Candidate Experience and Engagement: Lengthy and complex assessment processes can lead to candidate drop-off, negatively affecting employer branding and reducing the talent pool. Now a days Candidates just loose the patience, some of the companies I personally interviewed are king 6-7 rounds making the process tedious 
4.	Difficulty in Assessing Soft Skills: While technical skills can be evaluated, assessing crucial soft skills like communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, emotional intelligence, and creativity is challenging with traditional methods

User Experience:
For the assessment creator (recruiter), the key user flow will involve a straightforward process for creating or selecting assessments and assigning them to candidates.
Recruiters using the Cohort platform will experience seamless access to the AI-powered assessment feature. They can easily navigate to the tool and choose from a comprehensive library of pre-built assessments covering various skills and job types or create custom assessments tailored to specific role requirements. Customization options include adding specific questions, adjusting difficulty levels, and setting appropriate time limits. Once an assessment is created, recruiters can assign it to individual candidates or in bulk to multiple candidates simultaneously. They can send secure assessment invitations directly through the platform via email, providing candidates with a secure link to access the assessment. Once candidates complete the assessment, recruiters can conveniently view the results within the candidate’s profile on Cohort, which includes an overall score and a detailed breakdown of performance by section or question. Additionally, recruiters can integrate these results into their existing hiring workflow by automatically advancing candidates who meet predefined score thresholds.

Candidate Wireframe 
Candidates receiving an assessment invitation will experience a straightforward and user-friendly process. Upon receiving the email invitation from Cohort, they can access the assessment via a secure link with a single click. If the candidate is already registered on the platform, no separate login is required, making the process efficient and hassle-free. The assessment interface is designed to be clear, engaging, and respectful of the candidate’s time, allowing them to complete the assessment at their convenience within the timeframe specified by the recruiter.

Success Metrics
Leading Indicators
Feature Adoption Rate, which measures the percentage of Cohort's customers who are actively using the assessment feature , will be closely tracked on a monthly and quarterly basis
Assessment Completion Rate, representing the percentage of candidates who start and successfully complete the assigned assessments, will also be monitored as a key indicator of candidate engagement and the usability of the assessment tool.
Recruiter/Hiring Manager Satisfaction Scores will be gathered through regular surveys to assess their perceptions of the feature's usability, effectiveness in evaluating candidates, and overall value in the hiring process.
Lagging Indicators
Reduction in Time-to-Hire will be a critical metric, comparing the average time taken to fill open positions for customers who are using the assessment feature versus those who are not.
Improvement in Quality of Hire will be tracked through indicators such as new hire performance reviews, employee retention rates (e.g., after 6 months and 1 year)
Cost Savings per Hire will be analysed by comparing the overall recruitment costs for customers utilizing the assessment feature against those who are not.

Negative metrics 
•	Candidate feedback will be closely monitored for any reports of negative experiences or perceptions of bias related to the AI assessments. Any increase in candidate drop-off rates specifically during the assessment stage will be investigated.
